# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project, completed as part of the YBI Foundation Data Science with Python Internship, involves predicting bank customer churn using various machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to explore and apply different data preprocessing methods and machine learning algorithms to build a robust predictive model.

## Learning Objectives
Data Encoding: Transform categorical data into numerical values using techniques such as one-hot encoding and label encoding.
Feature Scaling: Normalize the feature set to ensure all features contribute equally to the model by applying standardization and normalization techniques.
Handling Imbalanced Data: Address class imbalance in the dataset using:
Random Under Sampling
Random Over Sampling
Support Vector Machine Classifier: Implement and train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict customer churn.
Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the SVM classifier's hyperparameters using Grid Search to improve model performance.

## Requirements
To run the project, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy,
scikit-learn,
matplotlib,
seaborn,
